  estimateDisclaimer: `THIS DOCUMENT CONSTITUTES AN ESTIMATE ONLY AND NOT A FIXED PRICE CONTRACT

This estimate is provided by North House Group, LLC ("Contractor") based on a Cost-Plus pricing model, whereby the Client agrees to pay the actual cost of materials and labor plus a twenty percent (20%) markup. The figures presented herein represent Contractor's best projection of costs based on the current scope of work as discussed and documented. The final invoice shall reflect the actual costs incurred during the course of construction.

Under this transparent pricing structure, Client will receive complete documentation including all receipts and time logs. There are no hidden markups on materials beyond the stated twenty percent. Should the project costs come in under the estimated amount, Client will pay only the actual costs plus markup. Conversely, if unforeseen conditions or issues arise during construction, costs may exceed this estimate.

It is critical that the scope of work be fully defined and approved by both parties before work commences. Any changes to the scope after work has begun shall be subject to a thirty-five percent (35%) markup through formal change order procedures. Hidden conditions discovered during the course of work, including but not limited to structural defects, mold, asbestos, or code violations, shall constitute additional work outside the original scope. Material price fluctuations beyond Contractor's control shall be passed through at actual cost.

By executing this agreement, Client acknowledges and agrees that this is an estimate based on the scope discussed, that actual costs may vary from this estimate, that payment will be based on actual costs plus the agreed-upon markup, and that change orders carry a higher markup rate of thirty-five percent (35%) versus the base markup of twenty percent (20%).`,

  paymentTerms: `Payment for services rendered shall be made according to the following schedule: thirty percent (30%) of the estimated contract price is due as a deposit upon execution of this Agreement to secure scheduling and initial material orders. An additional thirty percent (30%) shall be due at the project midpoint, as determined by Contractor based on work completed. Another thirty percent (30%) shall be due upon substantial completion of the Work, defined as the point at which the project is sufficiently complete for Owner's intended use. The final ten percent (10%) shall be due upon final completion, including all punch list items and final walkthrough approval.

All payments are due within five (5) business days of invoice receipt. Contractor accepts payment by check, ACH transfer, or credit card, with credit card payments subject to a three percent (3%) processing fee. Past due accounts shall be subject to interest charges of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, equivalent to eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Contractor reserves the right to suspend work on accounts more than ten (10) days past due after providing written notice. Contractor further reserves all lien rights available under Colorado law for unpaid balances.`,

  changeOrders: `Any and all modifications, additions, or deletions to the original scope of work ("Change Orders") must follow formal procedures to ensure clarity and mutual agreement. Owner must submit a written request describing the desired changes in detail. Contractor shall provide a written estimate for the requested changes within three (3) business days of receipt, weather and complexity permitting. No work on changes shall commence without signed written approval from Owner.

Change Order pricing reflects the increased costs and disruption to scheduled work flow. All Change Orders are billed at actual cost plus a thirty-five percent (35%) markup, compared to the twenty percent (20%) markup on base contract work. A minimum Change Order charge of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) applies to all changes regardless of scope. In emergency situations requiring immediate action, verbal authorization may be accepted with written documentation to follow within twenty-four (24) hours.

Owner acknowledges that Change Orders may extend the project timeline and that work sequencing may require stopping certain tasks until change work is complete. Rush processing of changes is available at an additional fifteen percent (15%) premium above standard Change Order rates.`,
